Task 3: Online Text Editor – Internship Project
As part of my internship with CodTech, I worked on Task 3, where I had to create a basic Online Text Editor. The main goal of this task was to build a web-based text editor that allows users to write and format text easily, just like in apps such as Google Docs or MS Word.

To complete this task, I used React.js as the main framework for building the frontend. I chose React because it’s good for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces using components. I also used a library called Quill.js to add rich text editing features like bold, italic, underline, headers, lists, and more. It made things easier because most of the features I needed were already available in it.

I used HTML and CSS for the basic structure and styling of the editor. I tried to keep the design clean and user-friendly. To manage the project and run it smoothly, I used Vite as the build tool, which helped with fast development and hot reloading. I also used npm to install the necessary packages and dependencies.

The editor I created includes a toolbar at the top which stays in place even when you scroll (sticky toolbar). This toolbar has buttons for formatting text, such as making it bold or italic, adding lists, and using different heading styles.

For writing the code, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which is my favorite code editor because it has useful extensions and tools that help with writing and debugging code.

This kind of text editor can be useful in many real-life applications, such as:

Writing blogs or articles on a blogging platform

Adding content to a website through a CMS (Content Management System)

Taking notes or writing assignments in an educational tool

Making simple documentation for personal or team use

Through this task, I learned how to work with external libraries like Quill in a React project. I also improved my skills in building responsive designs and handling component-based layouts. It was a good experience to combine tools and frameworks to build something useful and interactive.

Overall, this task helped me understand how real-world text editors work and gave me hands-on experience in web development using modern tools. I enjoyed working on it and learned a lot throughout the process.
